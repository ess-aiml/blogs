AI is revolutionizing the way we study and understand our planet. One of the most exciting developments in this space for years to come is *foundation models for Earth system*. In this post, we’ll break down what these models are and why they have so much potential.

### What is a foundation model?
> *A foundation model is an AI model trained on a massive amount of data (usually by unsupervised learning) and can be adapted to a wide range of tasks.*

They are a turning point in AI, replacing traditional models that were trained for a single purpose. Once pre-trained, foundation models can be adapted to numerous downstream applications with little to no additional training samples.
