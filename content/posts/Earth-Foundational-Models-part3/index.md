> Foundation models are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models that are trained on a massive amount of data and can be adapted to a wide range of tasks.

There are 5 key characteristics of Foundation Models:

1. Pretrained (using large data and massive compute so that it is ready to be used without any additional training)
2. Generalized — one model for many tasks (unlike traditional AI which was specific for a task such as image recognition)
3. Adaptable (through prompting — the input to the model using say text)
4. Large (in terms of model size and data size e.g. GPT-3 has 175B parameters and was trained on about 500,000 million words, equivalent of over 10 lifetimes of humans reading nonstop!)
5. Self-supervised (see footnote 1) — no specific labels are provided and the model has to learn from the patterns in the data which is provided — see the cake illustration below.
