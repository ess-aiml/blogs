Diffusion models have become one of the most powerful tools in artificial intelligence (AI). They‚Äôre the engines behind some of today's most advanced ***generative systems*** -- from creating realistic images, audio, text, and videos to designing new molecules and medicines, and even modeling complex climate and environmental systems.

There are already plenty of great articles that dive into the details of diffusion models -- and we‚Äôll share some of our favorites along the way. In this post, we'll keep thing simple: we focus on the core principles (part 1) and explore how diffusion models are being used in environmental science, and why those applications are so promising and exciting (this post).

Let‚Äôs get started!

### Diffusion models in environmental system science üåç
Earth‚Äôs environment is a complex network of interacting systems. From everyday temperature changes to extreme events like droughts, hailstorms, and El Ni√±o, natural variability shapes nearly every aspect of our planet‚Äôs behavior. These fluctuations influence water supply, agriculture, transportation, and energy production. Accurate forecasts of such variability are crucial‚Äîthey help societies prepare for hazards, manage renewable resources efficiently, and adapt to a changing climate.

Diffusion models offer a fresh approach to simulating Earth and environmental systems. Unlike traditional numerical models or earlier neural networks such as GANs and VAEs, diffusion models don‚Äôt rely on a single, fixed mapping from inputs to outputs. Instead, they start with random noise and gradually refine it over many steps, learning how realistic environmental patterns emerge from underlying randomness.

An example comes from [Guilloteau et al., (2025)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10912662), who developed a generative diffusion framework called DifERS for producing ensembles of precipitation maps from multisensor satellite data. Their method combines physical insight with statistical learning to reconstruct detailed rainfall patterns from coarse satellite inputs. Two novelties of their method thus are: 1) the handling of the uncertainty through the generation of ensembles of equiprobable realizations and 2) the use of coincident measurements from different instruments and different platforms.

Because diffusion models explicitly model the distribution of states rather than just the mean response, they are particularly well-suited for capturing uncertainty, extremes, and multi-scale variability‚Äîfeatures that are notoriously difficult for traditional deep learning architectures. For instance, recent studies [[Bassetti et al, (2024)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023MS004194), [Hess et al, (2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-00980-5)] have shown that diffusion-based emulators can reconstruct fine-scale rainfall structures from coarse reanalysis data while preserving the physical coherence of storm systems, something most conventional downscaling models tend to blur.
