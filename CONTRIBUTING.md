# Contributing to the Blog

Thank you for your interest in contributing! ðŸŽ‰
Weâ€™ve made it simple to share your post using *folder-per-post* structure â€” **no need to clone the repository**.

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|---------------|
| **GitHub Web Editor** | Create a new folder and `index.md` file directly on GitHub using the template, then submit a PR. |
| **Email** | Fill out the post template and email it to **lepv@ornl.gov**. Weâ€™ll handle the folder creation and publishing. |

## A. Submitting via GitHub Web Editor

1. Navigate to [`content/posts/`](https://github.com/ess-aiml/blogs/tree/main/content/posts) on GitHub.
2. Click **Add file â†’ Create new file**.
3. In the filename box, enter a unique folder name followed by `/index.md`.
   - Example: `my-new-post/index.md`
   - **Note:** If your post includes images, create an `images` subfolder inside your post folder (e.g., `my-new-post/images/`) and use relative links to reference them in your `index.md` file.
4. Copy and paste the following template into the editor:

    ```markdown
    ---
    title: "Your Post Title Here"
    date: YYYY-MM-DD
    tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
    author: "Your Name & Others"
    summary: "1â€“2 sentence summary of your post"
    ---

    Your main post content goes here.
    ```

5. Fill in your title, date, tags, author name, and content.
6. Click **Propose new file â†’ Create pull request**.

## B. Submitting via Email

1. Copy the template above into a new file named `my-new-post/index.md`.
2. Fill in your post details and content.
3. If your post includes images, place them in an `images` folder inside `my-new-post`.
4. Zip the entire `my-new-post` folder.
5. Send the zipped file to **lepv@ornl.gov**.
