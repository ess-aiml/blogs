      <description>A beginner’s guide to the powerful models shaping the future of Earth science</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Foundation models are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models that are trained on a massive amount of data and can be adapted to a wide range of tasks.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are 5 key characteristics of Foundation Models:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pretrained (using large data and massive compute so that it is ready to be used without any additional training)</li>
<li>Generalized — one model for many tasks (unlike traditional AI which was specific for a task such as image recognition)</li>
<li>Adaptable (through prompting — the input to the model using say text)</li>
<li>Large (in terms of model size and data size e.g. GPT-3 has 175B parameters and was trained on about 500,000 million words, equivalent of over 10 lifetimes of humans reading nonstop!)</li>
<li>Self-supervised (see footnote 1) — no specific labels are provided and the model has to learn from the patterns in the data which is provided — see the cake illustration below.</li>
</ol>
