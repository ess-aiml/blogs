      <description>A beginner’s guide to the powerful models shaping the future of Earth science</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI is revolutionizing the way we study and understand our planet. One of the most exciting developments in this space for years to come is <em>foundation models for Earth system</em>. In this post, we’ll break down what these models are and why they have so much potential.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>A foundation model is an AI model trained on a massive amount of data (usually by unsupervised learning) and can be adapted to a wide range of tasks.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>They are a turning point in AI, replacing traditional models that were trained for a single purpose. Once pre-trained, foundation models can be adapted to numerous downstream applications with little to no additional training samples.</p>
