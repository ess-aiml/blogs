      <description>A beginner’s guide to the powerful models shaping the future of Earth science</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Foundation models are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models that are trained on a massive amount of data and can be adapted to a wide range of tasks.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are 5 key characteristics of Foundation Models:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pretrained (using large data and massive compute so that it is ready to be used without any additional training)</li>
<li>Generalized — one model for many tasks (unlike traditional AI which was specific for a task such as image recognition)</li>
<li>Adaptable (through prompting — the input to the model using say text)</li>
<li>Large (in terms of model size and data size e.g. GPT-3 has 175B parameters and was trained on about 500,000 million words, equivalent of over 10 lifetimes of humans reading nonstop!)</li>
<li>Self-supervised (see footnote 1) — no specific labels are provided and the model has to learn from the patterns in the data which is provided — see the cake illustration below.</li>
</ol>

      <title>What are Diffusion Models? -- Test</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blogs/posts/intro-diffusion-models/</link>

      <description>A beginner’s guide to diffusion models</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diffusion models are a type of generative AI that create data by learning to reverse a process of gradually adding noise, turning random noise into realistic images, audio, or text. They are powerful because they generate high-quality results and are more stable to train than GANs.</p>
